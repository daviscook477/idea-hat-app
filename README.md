The idea hat app

The app uses npm and bower for dependencies.
To build the project use npm install in the project directory and then use bower install.
The project utilizes a folder structure based off of the angular best practices by google.
It makes the project modular by keeping seperate components of the application as separate angular modules.
Each module is stored in its own folder. The shared folder is for modules that will be used throughout the app.
The project uses grunt. To run commands use grunt "command"
